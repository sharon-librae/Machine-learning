# Machine-learning

Code.ipynb is recognition of numbers through image.

Project 1 applys linear regression, basis expansion and regularisation.


In machine learning project, I analysis data by linear regression model, basis expansion and regularisation. 
Also, I finished handwritten digit recognition by linear approach perceptron, basis expansion perceptron, kernel perceptron and dimensionality reduction.
